				<h4><b>The Night War</b></h4>

			</div>

			<p>It’s 1942. German Nazis occupy much of France. And twelve-year-old Miriam, who is Jewish, is not 
			safe. With help and quick thinking, Miri is saved from the roundup that takes her entire Jewish neighborhood. 
			She escapes Paris, landing in a small French village, where the spires of the famous Chateau de Chenonceau
			rise high into the sky, its bridge across the River Cher like a promise, a fairy tale. 
			<br><br>
			But Miri’s life is no fairy tale. Her parents are gone—maybe alive, maybe not. Taken in at the boarding
			school near the chateau, pretending to be Catholic to escape Nazi capture, Miri is called upon one night
			to undertake a deadly task, one that spans the castle grounds, its bridge, and the very border to freedom.
			Here is her chance to escape—hopefully to find her parents. But will she take it? One thing is certain:
			The person Miri meets that night will save her life. And the person Miri becomes that night could save 
			the lives of many more.
			<br><br>
			In her return to the era of The War that Saved My Life and The War I Finally Won, Kimberly Brubaker Bradley
			brings a new and different story, one with a mystical twist, that explores a little-known slice of World War
			II history, a highly unusual friendship, and the power of choosing courage even when—especially when—there
			are no good choices to be had.
