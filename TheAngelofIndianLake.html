			<p>It’s been four years in prison since Jade Daniels last saw her hometown of Proofrock, Idaho, the day she took the fall,
			protecting her friend Letha and her family from incrimination. Since then, her reputation, and the town, have changed dramatically. 
			There’s a lot of unfinished business in Proofrock, from serial killer cultists to the rich trying to buy Western authenticity. But 
			there’s one aspect of Proofrock no one wants to confront…until Jade comes back to town. The curse of the Lake Witch is waiting, and
			now is the time for the final stand.
			<br><br>
			New York Times bestselling author Stephen Graham Jones has crafted an epic horror trilogy of generational trauma from the Indigenous
			to the townies rooted in the mountains of Idaho. It is a story of the American west written in blood.</p>
