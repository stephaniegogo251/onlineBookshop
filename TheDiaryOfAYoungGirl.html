				<h4><b>The Diary of a Young Girl</b></h4>
				<p>Anne Frank</p>
				<p>★★★★☆ 4.19</p>

			<p>Discovered in the attic in which she spent the last years of her life, Anne Frank’s remarkable diary has
			become a world classic—a powerful reminder of the horrors of war and an eloquent testament to the human spirit.
			<br><br>
			In 1942, with the Nazis occupying Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in 
			Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, 
			the Franks and another family lived cloistered in the “Secret Annexe” of an old office building. Cut off from 
			the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the 
			ever-present threat of discovery and death. In her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences
			during this period. By turns thoughtful, moving, and surprisingly humorous, her account offers a fascinating 
			commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman
			whose promise was tragically cut short.</p>
