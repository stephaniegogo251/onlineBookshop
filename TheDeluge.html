			In the first decades of the 21st century, the world is convulsing, its governments mired in gridlock while a patient but
			unrelenting ecological crisis looms. America is in upheaval, battered by violent weather and extreme politics. In California
			in 2013, Tony Pietrus, a scientist studying deposits of undersea methane, receives a death threat. His fate will become bound
			to a stunning cast of characters—a broken drug addict, a star advertising strategist, a neurodivergent mathematician, a 
			cunning eco-terrorist, an actor turned religious zealot, and a brazen young activist named Kate Morris, who, in the mountains
			of Wyoming, begins a project that will alter the course of the decades to come.
			<br><br>
			From the Gulf Coast to Los Angeles, the Midwest to Washington, DC, their intertwined odysseys unfold against a stark backdrop
			of accelerating chaos as they summon courage, galvanize a nation, fall to their own fear, and find wild hope in the face of 
			staggering odds. As their stories hurtle toward a spectacular climax, each faces a reckoning: what will they sacrifice to salvage
			humanity’s last chance at a future? A singular achievement, The Deluge is a once-in-a-generation novel that meets the moment as
			few works of art ever have.
