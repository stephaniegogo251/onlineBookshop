				<h4><b>Annie Bot</b></h4>
				<p>Sierra Greer</p>
				<p>★★★★☆ 3.84</p>
			</div>

			<p>A powerful, provocative novel about the relationship between a female
			robot and her human owner, exploring questions of intimacy, power, autonomy,
			and control.
			<br><br>
			Annie Bot was created to be the perfect girlfriend for her human owner Doug.
			Designed to satisfy his emotional and physical needs, she has dinner ready
			for him every night, wears the pert outfits he orders for her, and adjusts 
			her libido to suit his moods. True, she’s not the greatest at keeping Doug’s
			place spotless, but she’s trying to please him. She’s trying hard.
			<br><br>
			She’s learning, too.
			<br><br>
			Doug says he loves that Annie’s AI makes her seem more like a real woman, so 
			Annie explores human traits such as curiosity, secrecy, and longing. But 
			becoming more human also means becoming less perfect, and as Annie’s relationship
			with Doug grows more intricate and difficult, she starts to wonder: Does Doug 
			really desire what he says he wants? And in such an impossible paradox, what 
			does Annie owe herself?</p>
