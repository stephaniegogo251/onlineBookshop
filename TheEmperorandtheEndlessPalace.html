			</div>

			<p>In the year 4 BCE, an ambitious courtier is called upon to seduce the young emperor—but quickly discovers they are both ruled by blood, sex and intrigue.
			<br><br>
			In 1740, a lonely innkeeper agrees to help a mysterious visitor procure a rare medicine, only to unleash an otherworldly terror instead.
			<br><br>
			And in present-day Los Angeles, a college student meets a beautiful stranger and cannot shake the feeling they’ve met before.
			<br><br>
			Across these seemingly unrelated timelines woven together only by the twists and turns of fate, two men are reborn, lifetime after lifetime. Within the treacherous walls of an ancient palace and the boundless forests of the Asian wilderness to the heart-pounding cement floors of underground rave scenes, our lovers are inexplicably drawn to each other, constantly tested by the worlds around them.
			<br><br>
			As their many lives intertwine, they begin to realize the power of their undying love—a power that transcends time itself…but one that might consume them both.</p>
