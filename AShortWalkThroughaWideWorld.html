			<p>Paris, 1885: Aubry Tourvel, a spoiled and stubborn nine-year-old girl, comes across a wooden puzzle ball on her
			walk home from school. She tosses it over the fence, only to find it in her backpack that evening. Days later, at 
			the family dinner table, she starts to bleed to death.
			<br><br>
			When medical treatment only makes her worse, she flees to the outskirts of the city, where she realizes that it is
			this very act of movement that keeps her alive. So begins her lifelong journey on the run from her condition, which
			won’t allow her to stay anywhere for longer than a few days nor return to a place where she’s already been.
			<br><br>
			From the scorched dunes of the Calashino Sand Sea to the snow-packed peaks of the Himalayas; from a bottomless well
			in a Parisian courtyard, to the shelves of an infinite underground library, we follow Aubry as she learns what it 
			takes to survive and ultimately, to truly live. But the longer Aubry wanders and the more desperate she is to share
			her life with others, the clearer it becomes that the world she travels through may not be quite the same as everyone else’s...
			<br><br>
			Fiercely independent and hopeful, yet full of longing, Aubry Tourvel is an unforgettable character fighting her way 
			through a world of wonders to find a place she can call home. A spellbinding and inspiring story about discovering 
			meaning in a life that seems otherwise impossible, A Short Walk Through a Wide World reminds us that it’s not the 
			destination, but rather the journey—no matter how long it lasts—that makes us who we are.</p>
