				<h4><b>Cold People</b></h4>
				<p>Tom Rob Smith</p>
				<p>★★★★☆ 3.52</p>
			</div>

			<p>The world has fallen. Without warning, a mysterious and omnipotent force has claimed the planet
			for their own. There are no negotiations, no demands, no reasons given for their actions. All they
			have is a message: humanity has thirty days to reach the one place on Earth where they will be allowed
			to exist… Antarctica.
			<br><br>
			Cold People follows the perilous journeys of a handful of those who endure the frantic exodus to the
			most extreme environment on the planet. But their goal is not merely to survive the present. Because
			as they cling to life on the ice, the remnants of their past swept away, they must also confront the
			urgent challenge: can they change and evolve rapidly enough to ensure humanity’s future? Can they build
			a new society in the sub-zero cold?
			<br><br>
			Original and imaginative, as profoundly intimate as it is grand in scope, is a masterful and unforgettable epic.
