			<p>These are just some of the questions you will find answered in this delightful collection of 
			stories recounting real-life incidents from the life of Sudha Murty-teacher, social worker and 
			bestselling writer. There is the engaging story about one of her students who frequently played 
			truant from school. The account of how her mother's advice to save money came in handy when she
			wanted to help her husband start a software company, and the heart-warming tale of the promise 
			she made-and fulfilled-to her grandfather, to ensure that her little village library would always
			be well supplied with books.
			<br><br>
			Funny, spirited and inspiring, each of these stories teaches a valuable lesson about the importance 
			of doing what you believe is right and having the courage to realize your dreams.
