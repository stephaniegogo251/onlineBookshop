			<p>Alan Conway is a bestselling crime writer. His editor, Susan Ryeland, has worked with him for years,
			and she's intimately familiar with his detective, Atticus Pünd, who solves mysteries disturbing sleepy 
			English villages. Alan's traditional formula pays homage to queens of classic British crime such as Agatha
			Christie and Dorothy Sayers. It's proved hugely successful. So successful that Susan must continue to put
			up with his troubling behavior if she wants to keep her job.
			<br><br>
			When Susan receives Alan's latest manuscript, in which Atticus Pünd investigates a murder at Pye Hall, an 
			English manor house, she has no reason to think it will be any different from the others. There will be dead
			bodies, a cast of intriguing suspects, and plenty of red herrings and clues. But the more Susan reads, the 
			more she realizes that there's another story hidden in the pages of the manuscript—one of ambition, jealousy,
			and greed—and that soon it will lead to murder.
			<br><br>
			Masterful, clever, and ruthlessly suspenseful, Magpie Murders is a deviously dark take on vintage crime fiction.</p>
