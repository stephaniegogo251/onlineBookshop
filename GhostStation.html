			<p>Space exploration can be lonely and isolating.
			<br><br>
			Psychologist Dr. Ophelia Bray has dedicated her life to the study and prevention of ERS—a space-based 
			condition most famous for a case that resulted in the brutal murders of twenty-nine people. When she's
			assigned to a small exploration crew, she's eager to make a difference. But as they begin to establish
			residency on an abandoned planet, it becomes clear that crew is hiding something.
			<br><br>
			While Ophelia focuses on her new role, her crewmates are far more interested in investigating the eerie,
			ancient planet and unraveling the mystery behind the previous colonizer's hasty departure than opening 
			up to her.
			<br><br>
			That is, until their pilot is discovered gruesomely murdered. Is this Ophelia’s worst nightmare starting—
			a wave of violence and mental deterioration from ERS? Or is it something more sinister?
			<br><br>
			Terrified that history will repeat itself, Ophelia and the crew must work together to figure out what’s 
			happening. But trust is hard to come by… and the crew isn’t the only one keeping secrets.</p>
