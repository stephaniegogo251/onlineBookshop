		<p>In a shabby house, on a shabby street, in the new capital of Madrid, Luzia Cotado uses scraps of magic to get through her days
		of endless toil as a scullion. But when her scheming mistress discovers the lump of a servant cowering in the kitchen is actually 
		hiding a talent for little miracles, she demands Luzia use those gifts to better the family's social position.
		<br><br>
		What begins as simple amusement for the bored nobility takes a perilous turn when Luzia garners the notice of Antonio Pérez,
		the disgraced secretary to Spain's king. Still reeling from the defeat of his armada, the king is desperate for any advantage in
		the war against England's heretic queen—and Pérez will stop at nothing to regain the king's favor.
		<br><br>
		Determined to seize this one chance to better her fortunes, Luzia plunges into a world of seers and alchemists, holy men
		and hucksters, where the line between magic, science, and fraud is never certain. But as her notoriety grows, so does the danger 
		that her Jewish blood will doom her to the Inquisition's wrath. She will have to use every bit of her wit and will to survive—even
		if that means enlisting the help of Guillén Santangel, an embittered immortal familiar whose own secrets could prove deadly for them both.</p>
