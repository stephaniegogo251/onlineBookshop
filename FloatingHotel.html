			<p>Welcome to the Grand Abeona home of the finest food, the sweetest service,
			and the very best views the galaxy has to offer. All year round it moves from 
			planet to planet, system to system, pampering guests across the furthest reaches
			of the milky way. The last word in sub-orbital luxury—and an absolute magnet 
			for intrigue. Intrigues such Why are there love poems in the lobby inbox? How 
			many Imperial spies are currently on board? What is the true purpose of the Problem 
			Solver’s conference? And perhaps most pertinently— who is driving the ship?
			<br><br>
			Each guest has a secret, every member of staff a universe unto themselves. At 
			the center of these interweaving lives and interlocking mysteries stands Carl, one
			time stowaway, longtime manager, devoted caretaker to the hotel. It’s the love of 
			his life and the only place he’s ever called home. But as forces beyond Carl’s 
			comprehension converge on the Abeona, he has to face one final when is it time to
			let go?</p>
