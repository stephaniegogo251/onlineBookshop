			<p>Alicia Berenson’s life is seemingly perfect. A famous painter married to an in-demand fashion photographer,
			she lives in a grand house with big windows overlooking a park in one of London’s most desirable areas. One evening
			her husband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then
			never speaks another word.
			<br><br>
			Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far grander, a
			mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety. The price of her art skyrockets, and
			she, the silent patient, is hidden away from the tabloids and spotlight at the Grove, a secure forensic unit in 
			North London.
			<br><br>
			Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with Alicia. His 
			determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes him down a twisting path
			into his own motivations—a search for the truth that threatens to consume him....
			<br><br>
			The Silent Patient is a shocking psychological thriller of a woman’s act of violence against her husband—and of the 
			therapist obsessed with uncovering her motive.</p>
