			<p><b>This is a world divided by blood—red or silver.</b>
			<br><br>
			The Reds are commoners, ruled by a Silver elite in possession of god-like superpowers. And to 
			Mare Barrow, a seventeen-year-old Red girl from the poverty-stricken Stilts, it seems like nothing
			will ever change.
			<br><br>
			That is until she finds herself working in the Silver Palace. Here, surrounded by the people she 
			hates the most, Mare discovers that, despite her red blood, she possesses a deadly power of her own.
			One that threatens to destroy the balance of power.
			<br><br>
			Fearful of Mare's potential, the Silvers hide her in plain view, declaring her a long-lost Silver 
			princess, now engaged to a Silver prince. Despite knowing that one misstep would mean her death, Mare
			works silently to help the Red Guard, a militant resistance group, and bring down the Silver regime.
			<br><br>
			But this is a world of betrayal and lies, and Mare has entered a dangerous dance—Reds against Silvers,
			prince against prince, and Mare against her own heart.</p>
