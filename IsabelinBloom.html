		<p>A Filipina-American girl discovers a connection between her two homes through a culinary garden in this middle grade novel that
		celebrates nourishment and growth—both in our lives and in nature.
		<br><br>
		Twelve-year-old Isabel is the new kid in her San Francisco middle school. It’s the first time in many years that she’ll be living with
		her mother again. Mama's job in the US allowed Isabel and her grandparents to live more comfortably in the Philippines, but now Isabel
		doesn't really know her own mother anymore.
		<br><br>
		Making new friends in a new city, a new country, is hard, but joining the gardening and cooking club at school means Isabel will begin
		to find her way, and maybe she too, will begin to bloom.
		<br><br>
		In this beautifully rendered novel-in-verse, Mae Respicio explores how growth can take many forms, offering both the challenges and joy
		of new beginnings.</p>
