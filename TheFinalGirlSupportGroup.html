			<p>In horror movies, the final girls are the ones left standing when the credits roll. They made
			it through the worst night of their lives…but what happens after?
			<br><br>
			Like his bestselling novel The Southern Book Club’s Guide to Slaying Vampires, Grady Hendrix’s latest
			is a fast-paced, frightening, and wickedly humorous thriller. From chain saws to summer camp slayers,
			The Final Girl Support Group pays tribute to and slyly subverts our most popular horror films—movies like
			The Texas Chainsaw Massacre , A Nightmare on Elm Street , and Scream.
			<br><br>
			Lynnette Tarkington is a real-life final girl who survived a massacre. For more than a decade, she’s been
			meeting with five other final girls and their therapist in a support group for those who survived the 
			unthinkable, working to put their lives back together. Then one woman misses a meeting, and their worst fears
			are realized—someone knows about the group and is determined to rip their lives apart again, piece by piece.
			<br><br>
			But the thing about final girls is that no matter how bad the odds, how dark the night, how sharp the knife, 
			they will never, ever give up.</p>
