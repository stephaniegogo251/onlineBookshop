			<p>After their mother passes, three estranged siblings reunite to sort out her estate.
			<br><br>
			Beth, the oldest, never left home. She stayed with her mom, caring for her until the very end.
			<br><br>
			Nicole, the middle child, has been kept at arm's length due to her ongoing battle with a serious
			 drug addiction.
			<br><br>
			Michael, the youngest, lives out of state and hasn't been back to their small Wisconsin town 
			since their father ran out on them seven years before.
			<br><br>
			While going through their parent's belongings, the siblings stumble upon a collection of home videos
			 and decide to revisit those happier memories. However, the nostalgia is cut short when one of the VHS
			 tapes reveals a night back in 1999 that none of them have any recollection of. On screen, their father
			 appears covered in blood. What follows is a dead body and a pact between their parents to get rid of 
			 it, before the video abruptly ends. Beth, Nicole, and Michael must now decide whether to leave the past
			 in the past or uncover the dark secret their mother took to her grave.</p>
