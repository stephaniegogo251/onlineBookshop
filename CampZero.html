				<h4><b>Camp Zero</b></h4>
				<p>Michelle Min Sterling</p>
				<p>★★★★☆ 3.22</p>
			</div>

			<p>In the far north of Canada sits Camp Zero, an American building project hiding many secrets.
			<br><br>
			Desperate to help her climate-displaced Korean immigrant mother, Rose agrees to travel to Camp 
			Zero and spy on its architect in exchange for housing. She arrives at the same time as another 
			newcomer, a college professor named Grant who is determined to flee his wealthy family’s dark 
			legacy. Gradually, they realize that there is more to the architect than previously thought, and
			a disturbing mystery lurks beneath the surface of the camp. At the same time, rumors abound of 
			an elite group of women soldiers living and working at a nearby Cold War-era climate research 
			station. What are they doing there? And who is leading them?
			<br><br>
			An electrifying page-turner where nothing is as it seems, Camp Zero cleverly explores how the 
			intersection of gender, class, and migration will impact who and what will survive in a warming world.
