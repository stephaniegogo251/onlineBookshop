			<p>Journeys to the end of the world, fantastic creatures, and epic battles between good and evil—what 
			more could any reader ask for in one book? The book that has it all is The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,
			written in 1949 by Clive Staples Lewis. But Lewis did not stop there. Six more books followed, and together
			they became known as The Chronicles of Narnia.
			<br><br>
			For the past fifty years, The Chronicles of Narnia have transcended the fantasy genre to become part of the
			canon of classic literature. Each of the seven books is a masterpiece, drawing the reader into a land where
			magic meets reality, and the result is a fictional world whose scope has fascinated generations.
			<br><br>
			This edition presents all seven books—unabridged—in one impressive volume. The books are presented here in
			chronlogical order, each chapter graced with an illustration by the original artist, Pauline Baynes. Deceptively
			simple and direct, The Chronicles of Narnia continue to captivate fans with adventures, characters, and truths
			that speak to readers of all ages, even fifty years after they were first published.</p>
