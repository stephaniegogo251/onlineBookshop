			<p>Michael Mace, the security chief at a top secret lab known as the Beautification Research Project, is killed by a microbial
			infection that sweeps through the building — but then he mysteriously comes back to life. Michael is not the same after his experience:
			He now has the ability to interact with and control all manner of digital tools, from cell phones to mainframe computers. His newfound 
			skills throw him into all kinds of pulse-pounding situations as he works to prevent a young teenager from joining a gang and tries to 
			elude a brutal assassin who’s on his trail. </p>
