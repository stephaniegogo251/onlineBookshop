		<p>The Devil knows your name, David Aristarkhov.
		<br><br>
		As a teen, David Aristarkhov was a psychic prodigy, operating under the shadow of his oppressive occultist father. 
		Now, years after his father’s death and rapidly approaching his thirtieth birthday, he is content with the high-powered 
		life he’s curated as a Boston attorney, moonlighting as a powerful medium for his secret society.
		<br><br>
		But with power comes a price, and the Devil has come to collect on an ancestral deal. David’s days are numbered, and
		death looms at his door.
		<br><br>
		Reluctantly, he reaches out to the only person he’s ever trusted, his ex-boyfriend and secret Society rival Rhys, for
		help. However, the only way to get to Rhys is through his wife, Moira. Thrust into each other’s care, emotions once buried
		deep resurface, and the trio race to figure out their feelings for one another before the Devil steals David away for good…
		<br><br>
		The first book in a spellbinding and vibrant new series from The Sunday Times bestselling author of A Dowry of Blood.</p>
